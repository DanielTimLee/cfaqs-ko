This is the source files for the Korean version of C Programming FAQ,
the official FAQ from Usenet comp.lang.c which is written by Steve
Summit <scs@eskimo.com>.

The original version (in English) can be found at

To build the output, you need recent version of Latex, and latex2html.
I tested in following environment:

    TexLive 2010  (in Gentoo Linux)      http://tug.org/texlive/
    latex2html 2008  (in Gentoo Linux)   http://www.latex2html.org/

Once you're prepared, simply run 'make' to build PDF and HTML output.

    $ make
